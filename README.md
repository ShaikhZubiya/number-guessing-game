# 🎮 Number Guessing Game
This is a fun Python console game where you guess a random number chosen by the computer. It's a simple project I created to practice my Python skills, specifically working with loops, conditionals, and user input.
## 🔹 How It Works
- The computer generates a number between 1 and 100.
- You enter your guess, and the game will tell you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- The game continues until you guess correctly.
I created this as part of my learning process with Python, and it was fun to implement a basic game like this. I plan to add more features in the future!
## 📁 File
- `guess_game.py` — main game script
## ▶️ How to Run
Make sure Python is installed on your system, then run:
```bash
python guess_game.py
